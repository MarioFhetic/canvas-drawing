1/ The clock is made entirely of canvas, I helped myself with the course and the internet

2/ The is an animation with the cloud, it moves to the right very slowly 

3/ When we go to hover on the board, the cursor becomes a chalk, we can draw on it

4/ The user can also change the color of his drawing

5/ The user can also erase what he wrote or draw with the eraser below the colors

6/ I tried to erase the table with the property destination out but it did not work (I left the function in comment)
